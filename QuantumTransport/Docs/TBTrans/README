Brief Description:

The tbtrans code is used in order to obtain, in a post-processing way, the transport properties after 
a TranSIESTA run. It was developed by M. Brandbyge, and the present version contains some 
modifications made by F. D. Novaes.

In order to run it, it requires the electrode's TSHS files (may be just one file if the left and right 
electrodes are equal), and the scattering region's TSHS file. These  are generated in a TranSIESTA run. 
The location of these files are specified by the (fdf) input options:

TS.HSFileLeft  
TS.HSFileRight
TS.TBT.HSFile

respectively for the left and right electrodes and the scattering region (for the latter one, 
if nothing is  specified, it is assumed that the file name is is “system label”.TSHS file, and located 
in the same directory from where the calculation is being launched).

The energy widow and number of points for the computation of the transmission function is specified by

TS.TBT.Emin 
TS.TBT.Emax 
TS.TBT.NPoints

The current will be computed using the resulting transmission function, so be sure to make it suited 
for the integration in the bias window. 

The averaged (over k-points) transmission function is printed in the file “system label”.AVTRANS.

The present version of the code is only parallelized over k-points, so the number of nodes should not 
be bigger than the number of k-points.



Compiling:

Similar to SIESTA (and TranSIESTA), an arch.make file has to be put in the main directory of TBTrans. 
It is also necessay to indicate wher the SIESTA Src directory is located. By default it is assumed 
to be ../../Src from the Util directory. If this is not the case, change the SIESTA_DIR variable value 
in the Makefile. To compile, type “make”
